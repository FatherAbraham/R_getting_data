Course Project for the Getting Data Course

The objective of the project is to provide a summary dataset.  The data set shows a summary of average sensor values for a range of six activities for 30 subjects.  This is produced by run_analysis.R, a script which sources the data locally, ingests, merges, reduces, tidies up, and aggregates by subject and activity type, before writing out to a csv file.

This repo contains the following:

Codebook.txt          -   a code book explaining the contents of Tidy Data Set.csv
run_analysis.R        -   script that produces the following file
Tidy Data Set.csv     -   a Tidy Data Set
